# ILE API

[How to Run the ILE](./README.md#ile-scene-generator)

#### Table of Content:
- [Classes](#Classes)
- [Options](#Options)

#### Example Configuration Files:
- [Simple](./ile_config.yaml)
- [Advanced](./ile_config_advanced.yaml)

#### Noteworthy Configuration Options:
- The [goal](#goal) option, if you want to set a goal for your scenes,
like "find and pickup the soccer ball" (by default, there is no goal: the
scenes can be used for undirected exploration).
- The [last_step](#last_step) option, if you want to force your scenes to end
after a specific number of actions/steps.

## Classes

Some [configurable ILE options](#Options) use the following classes
(represented as dicts in the YAML):

#### GoalConfig

A dict with str `category` and optional `target`, `target_1`, and
`target_2` properties that represents the goal and target object(s) in each
scene. The `target*` properties are only needed if required for the
specific category of goal. Each `target*` property is either an
InteractableObjectConfig dict or list of InteractableObjectConfig dicts.
For each list, one dict will be randomly chosen within the list in each
new scene.

Example:
```
category: retrieval
target:
    shape: soccer_ball
```

#### InteractableObjectConfig

Represents the template for a specific object (with one or more possible
variations) that will be added to each scene. Each template can have the
following optional properties:
- `num` (int, or list of ints, or [MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt) dict): The number
of objects with this template to generate in each scene. For a list or a
MinMaxInt, a new number will be randomly chosen for each scene.
Default: `1`
- `material` (string, or list of strings): The material (color/texture) to
use on this object in each scene. For a list, a new material will be
randomly chosen for each scene. Default: random
- `position` ([VectorFloatConfig](#VectorFloatConfig) dict, or list of
VectorFloatConfig dicts): The position of this object in each scene. For a
list, a new position will be randomly chosen for each scene.
Default: random
- `rotation` ([VectorIntConfig](#VectorIntConfig) dict, or list of
VectorIntConfig dicts): The rotation of this object in each scene. For a
list, a new rotation will be randomly chosen for each scene.
Default: random
- `scale` (float, or list of floats, or [MinMaxFloat](#MinMaxFloat) dict,
or list of MinMaxFloat dicts, or [VectorFloatConfig](#VectorFloatConfig)
dict, or list of VectorFloatConfig dicts): The scale of this object in each
scene. A single float will be used as the scale for all object dimensions
(X/Y/Z). For a list or a MinMaxFloat, a new scale will be randomly chosen
for each scene. Default: `1`
- `shape` (string, or list of strings): The shape (object type) of this
object in each scene. For a list, a new shape will be randomly chosen for
each scene. Default: random
- `keyword_location`: ([KeywordLocationConfig](#KeywordLocationConfig)):
Used to identify one of the qualitative locations specified by keywords.
This field should not be set when `position` or `rotation` are also set.
- `label` (string, or list of strings): labels to associate with this
object.  Components can use this label to reference this object or a group
of objects.  Labels do not need to be unique and when objects share a
labels, components have options to randomly choose one or choose all.  See
specific label options for details.

Example:
```
num: 1
material: "Custom/Materials/Blue"
position:
    x: 3
    z: 3
rotation:
    y: 90
scale: 1.5
shape: ball
```

Labels Example:
```
specific_interactable_objects:
  -
    num: 1
    position:
      x: 3
      z: 3
    rotation:
      y: 90
    shape: chest_3
    scale: 1.5
    labels: my_container
  -
    num: 1
    material: "Custom/Materials/Blue"
    scale: 0.5
    shape: ball
    keyword_location:
      keyword: in
      container_label: my_container
  -
    num: 1
    material: "Custom/Materials/Blue"
    scale: 0.5
    shape: ball
    keyword_location:
      keyword: adjacent
      relative_object_label: my_container
```

#### KeywordLocationConfig

Describes an object's keyword location. Can have the following
properties:
- `keyword` (string, or list of strings): The keyword location, which can
be one of the following:
    - `front` - The object will be placed in a line in front of the
    performer's start position.
    - `back` - The object will be placed in the 180 degree arc behind the
    performer's start position.
    - `between` - The object will be placed between the performer's start
    position and another object.  The other object must be referenced by
    the 'relative_object_label' field.  If multiple objects have this
    label, one will be randomly chosen.
    - `adjacent` - The object will be placed next to another object.  The
    other object must be referenced by the 'relative_object_label' field.
    If multiple objects have this label, one will be randomly chosen.
    - `in` - The object will be placed inside a container.  The container
    must be referenced by the 'container_label' field.  If multiple objects
    have this label, one will be randomly chosen.
    - `in_with` - The object will be placed inside a container along with
    another object.  The container must be referenced by the
    'container_label' field.  The other object must be referenced by the
    'relative_object_label'
    field.  If multiple objects have these label, one will be randomly
    chosen for each field.
- `container_label` (string, or list of strings): The label of a container
object that already exists in your configuration. Only required by some
keyword locations.
- `relative_object_label` (string, or list of strings): The label of a
second object that already exists in your configuration. Only required by
some keyword locations.

#### KeywordObjectsConfig

Describes a single group of a keyword objects.  Keyword objects has the
following properties:
- `keyword` (string, or list of strings): The type of object, like
confusor, container, obstacle, or occluder.
If an array is given, one will be chosen for each creation of this group.
    - `"confusors"`: Objects that are similar to the target in two of the
    following: color, shape, size.
    - `"containers"`: Receptacles that can contain other objects and can
    open and close, like chests.  These containers can be of any size.
    - `"containers_can_contain_target"`: Receptacles that can contain other
    objects and can open and close, like chests.  These containers
    will be large enough to contain the target.  If a goal target does
    not exist, generation will fail.
    - `"containers_cannot_contain_target"`: Receptacles that can contain
    other objects and can open and close, like chests.  These containers
    will not be large enough to contain the target.  If a goal target does
    not exist, generation will fail.
    - `"obstacles"`: Objects that prevent movement through/under them but
    allow sight through them, like chairs or tables with four individual
    legs.
    - `"occluders"`: Objects that prevent both movement through/under them
    AND sight through them, like sofas or bookcases with solid back panels.
    This is completely different from the occluders in passive
    intuitive physics scenes.
    - `"context"`: Objects (also called "distractors") that are small,
    pickupable, and serve to clutter the room to possibly distract the AI.
    They are never the same shape as the target object, if the scene has a
    goal with a target object.
- `num` (int, or list of ints, or [MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt) dict, or list of
MinMaxInt dicts): The number of this object the user wants to create.
- `keyword_location`: ([KeywordLocationConfig](#KeywordLocationConfig)):
One of the keyword locations for this object or set of objects. Any choices
in `keyword_location` are made for each object inside the group, not the
group as a whole.

#### MinMaxFloat

A dict with float `min` and float `max` properties that represents a
random inclusive numerical range. A float will be randomly chosen from
within the range in each new scene.

Example:
```
min: 0.5
max: 1.5
```

#### MinMaxInt

A dict with int `min` and int `max` properties that represents a
random inclusive numerical range. An int will be randomly chosen from
within the range in each new scene.

Example:
```
min: 1
max: 10

options for this group.  The options include the following:
    - `l_occluders`: Random L-shaped occluders
    - `platforms`: Random platforms
    - `ramps`: Random ramps
    - `walls` Random interior room walls

and can only use the `"Pass"` action. For example, if 1, the performer
agent must pass immediately at the start of the scene.  This is an
inclusive limit.
- `end` (int, or list of ints, or [MinMaxInt](#MinMaxInt) dict, or list
of MinMaxInt dicts):
The step where the performer agent ends being frozen and can resume
using actions besides `"Pass"`.  Therefore, this is an exclusive limit.

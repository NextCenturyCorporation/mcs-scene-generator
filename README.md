## Overview

The ILE ("Interactive Learning Environment") Scene Generator is used to generate training scenes for MCS Eval 5 and beyond. The intent of the ILE is to allow teams to train on concepts core to common sense reasoning, like physics, occlusion, navigation, localization, agency, and more. Test scenes will be comprised of combinations of these concepts, and the simulation environment (or the "world") is the same for both training (via the ILE) and testing. Please note the ILE does not rely on the hypercube designs that the MSC evaluation team uses to generate its test scenes.

The ILE runs using a YAML config file to set scene options. To see all config file properties, please review the [ILE_API.md](./ILE_API.md) documentation.

Please note that we consider our "passive" tasks to be a subset of our "interactive" tasks. Therefore the Interactive Learning Environment is also built to support generating training scenes for passive tasks as well.

The ILE outputs JSON files in the [MCS scene format](https://nextcenturycorporation.github.io/MCS/schema.html) to be run with the [machine_common_sense](https://github.com/NextCenturyCorporation/MCS) python library and corresponding Unity build.

If you wish to request a new feature or report a bug, please post on the MCS Slack tagging `@ta2devs`, or this GitHub repository's [Issues page](https://github.com/NextCenturyCorporation/mcs-scene-generator/issues).

### Latest Release Notes

#### Release 2.0

Changelog:
- Added novel objects for Eval 7.

#### Release 1.12

Changelog:
- Addressed various issues with "hooked" and "isosceles" tools:
  - Added information to the ILE_API about the "isosceles" tools (hooked tools with two equal sides).
  - Fixed bugs with generating hooked and isosceles tools using the `shortcut_target_lava_tool` config option, causing them to start positioned colliding with the target object (soccer ball).
  - Fixed `tool_offset_backward_from_lava` so that it works correctly with hooked and isosceles tools.
  - Updated `ile_configs/tools.yaml` with more comments.
- Added the `size` property to the `holes` and `lava` config options for generating contiguous holes and/or pools of lava composed of multiple 1x1 areas.
  - Updated `ile_configs/navigation_2d.yaml` to use the new `size` property.
  - Added `ile_configs/tool_with_more_lava.yaml` to demonstrate adding extra pools of lava in a scene that has the `shortcut_lava_target_tool` config option enabled.
- Changed `tool_rotation` (in the `shortcut_lava_target_tool` config option) to default to a random rotation (`[0, 45, 90, 135, 180, 225, 270, 315]`) rather than `0`.
- Updated the `check_valid_path` config option to alternatively accept a string object label to use rather than the "target" object label (which continues to be the default). Furthermore, `check_valid_path` can now validate paths to multiple objects in the scene if necessary.
- Updated the `performer_starts_near` global config option and the `distance_between_performer_and_tool` property (in the `shortcut_target_lava_tool` config option) to support varying min/max ranges that will adjust based on the room's dimensions. See the ILE_API for details.

#### Release 1.11

Changelog:
- Updated `ile_configs/interactive_knowledgeable_agents.yaml` to depict both of the simulation-controlled agents rotating 180 degrees at the start of each scene

#### Release 1.10

Changelog:
- Added `ile_configs/interactive_knowledgeable_agents.yaml`
- Added the `knowledgeable_agent_pair` option to generate a pair of knowledgeable and non-knowledgeable agents.
- Added the `placers_with_decoy` option to generate a pair of placers, one of which being a decoy.
- Added the `structural_notched_occluders` option to generate notched occluders (like in the Knowledgeable Agents task).
- Added the `empty_placer` option to configure placers which don't hold, pick up, and/or move anything else.
- Added the `surrounded_by_lava` and `surrounding_lava_size` options, previously only available for interactable objects, for configuring tools surrounded by lava.
- Added the `surrounding_safe_zone` option for configuring safe zones around tools and interactable objects which are surrounded by lava.
- Added the `wall_height` option for configuring triple door occluders.
- Agents configured to point at an object now correctly rotate to face that object before starting to point.
- Agents configured to point at an object positioned underneath them now point at a downward angle.
- Agents configured to point at an object which is moved by a placer now point at that object's new position.
- Doors may now have knobs on the right side and open to the left.

#### Release 1.9

Changelog:
- Added ILE example configs for Eval 7 tasks:
  - `ile_configs/interactive_hidden_set_rotation.yaml`
  - `ile_configs/interactive_multi_tool_use.yaml`
- Added "isosceles" tools for tool tasks: similar to "hooked" tools, which have one side of exactly length 3, and one side of variable length, "isosceles" tools have two sides of equal length.
- Added `adjacent_corner` keyword for `keyword_location` options to position an object in the corner of the room.
- Added `align_with` option in ToolConfig to position a tool in alignment with another object.
- Added `labels` option to AgentConfig and KeywordObjectsConfig to set custom labels on those entities.
- Added `materials` option in ToolConfig to set tool color/texture. By default, this is randomized among all available tool materials (currently: grey, brown, green, or pink).

- Added new open-topped container objects (like trash bins and lidless crates) for Spatial Reorientation and other scenes.
- Updated `ile_configs/interactive_arithmetic.yaml` and `ile_configs/interactive_number_comparison.yaml` to have occluders that come down at the start of the scene. See the comments in these files for more information, including instructions on how to remove them if desired.
- Updated `ile_configs/interactive_spatial_reference.yaml` to correctly "freeze" the performer agent until everything else in the scene stops moving.
- Updated `ile_configs/interactive_collision.yaml` and `ile_configs/interactive_trajectory.yaml` to generate rooms of varying depths.
- Updated `ile_configs/interactive_imitation.yaml` to rotate containers similarly to the eval scenes.
- Updated `ile_configs/interactive_moving_target_prediction.yaml` to use `shortcut_start_on_platform`.
- Updated `ile_configs/interactive_spatial_reorientation.yaml` to have the correct starting Z position for the performer agent, as well as the correct black "blocking walls" on top of the platform.
- Bug fix: Doors should always be different colors from their surrounding walls (including door occluder sections).
- Bug fix: Lids can now be placed on top of containers after they have been rotated.
- Bug fix: Rotations are allowed to be floats.
- Bug fix: Turntable (rotating_cog) material should default to GreyWoodMCS.

#### Release 1.8

Changelog:
- Added `ile_configs/interactive_collision.yaml` and `ile_configs/interactive_trajectory.yaml` to generate training data for the Interactive Collision and Interactive Trajectory tasks.
- Fixed a bug with open-topped buckets/containers accidentally falling over in some scenes.
- Fixed a bug with placers sometimes releasing an object too far above the ground (or platform), unintentionally causing the object to bounce.
- Fixed minor bugs in Seeing Leads to Knowing ILE scenes: ensure the placers exit your viewport before the agent begins moving toward a container; ensure the containers all have the same rotation.
- Fixed the width of the "blocking wall" used in some ILE scenes.
- Implemented a two-door-occluder (`shortcut_double_door_choice`) for the interactive collision and trajectory tasks.
- Implemented the `adjacent_to_wall` config property for `structural_platforms` to always position them next to a room wall. Updated the "ramps" example config file to use this option.
- Implemented the `freeze_while_moving` config option to "freeze" the performer agent until one or more specified objects are completely finished moving (like placers and turntables). Updated the Arithmetic, Set Rotation, and Shell Game example config files to use this option.
- Implemented the `long_with_two_ramps` config property for `structural_platforms` to generate a platform bisecting the room. Updated the "ramps" example config file to use this option.
- Implemented support for "broken" and "inaccessible" as the `tool_type` of the `shortcut_lava_target_tool` config option. Added new shortcut sub-properties to control the position of the tool.
- Randomly colored walls will no longer be assigned the same colors used for placers (cyan/magenta).

#### Release 1.7

Changelog:
- Added `ile_confgs/interactive_arithmetic.yaml` for generating training data for the Arithmetic (Addition/Subtraction) task. Added the `forced_choice_multi_retrieval_target` and `move_down_only` config properties to support these scenes.
- Added `ile_confgs/passive_seeing_leads_to_knowing.yaml` for generating training data for the Seeing Leads to Knowing task. Added the `shortcut_seeing_leads_to_knowing` config property to support these scenes.
- Added the `end_rotation_after` config property for turntables, to set the total amount of degrees they should rotate rather than the number of steps. Updated `ile_configs/interactive_set_rotation.yaml`.
- Added the `occluder_gap` and `occluder_gap_viewport` config properties to set a specific distance (or range) between multiple occluders and/or the edge of the viewport in passive physics scenes. Updated `ile_configs/passive_physics_fall_down.yaml` and `ile_configs/passive_physics_move_across.yaml`.
- Added the `separate_lid_after` config property for containers with separate lids to "place" their lids after one or more other objects stop moving/rotating.
- Added the `sidesteps` config property, primarily for generating training data for the Set Rotation task, which forces the performer agent to use Move and Rotate actions to circumnavigate a specific object.
- Added many new config properties for placers, including: `activate_after` and `activate_on_start_or_after`, to activate them after one or more other objects stop moving/rotating; `existing_object_required`, to prevent the ILE from generating a new object for a placer to hold; `randomize_once`, to use the same randomized options for more than one placer; `retain_position`, to prevent the ILE from moving an object when it is given to a new placer.
- Fixed the mass of containers-with-separate-lids so they will not fall over.
- Fixed the size of chests in imitation scenes, and made sure the soccer ball was visible up near the ceiling before the correct sequence of actions was performed.
- Reduced the default maximum X/Z room size to 25, including for the holes, lava, ramps, and tools example configs, corresponding to a similar reduction in the upcoming evaluation dataset.
- Updated `ile_configs/interactive_shell_game.yaml` so sometimes two containers are moved, and sometimes the container(s) are moved before the target and lids are "placed" in/on the containers.

#### Release 1.6

Changelog:
- Implemented asymmetric (a.k.a. "hooked" or "L-shape") tool shapes, and added the "tool_type" config option for the shortcut_lava_target_tool property to configure the type of tool.
- Implemented containers with separate lids that are placed onto them (shape="separate_container").
- Implemented devices that look like our "placers" but pick up or drag objects rather than placing them (see the "placers" property). Also added the "placed_object_above" config option for placers.
- Implemented new options for the shortcut_bisecting_platform property, including "is_short", "is_thin", and "other_platforms".
- Implemented "pointing" config option for agents.
- Added the restrict_open_objects property for generating Set Rotation and Shell Game scenes.
- Added the shortcut_imitation_task property for generating Imitation scenes.
- Added the shortcut_tool_choice property for generating Tool Choice scenes.
- Added the turntables_agent_non_agent_config property for generating Spatial Reference scenes.
- Fixed using min/max for `distance` in `performer_starts_near`.
- Revised the "adjacent" keyword_location to work in global coordinates (using the new "adjacent_distance" property), rather than based on the position of the performer agent.
- Updated the "placers" ILE config file to include examples of "placers" picking up objects.
- Added new example ILE config files:
    - Basic usage and core common sense concepts:
        - `agent_pointing_at_hidden_target`
        - `container_with_separate_lid`
    - New evaluation tasks:
        - `interactive_imitation`
        - `interactive_set_rotation`
        - `interactive_shell_game`
        - `interactive_spatial_reference`
        - `interactive_tool_choice`

#### Release 1.5

Changelog:
- Major changes to how all passive physics scenes are made, so they fully align with the evaluation data:
    - Replaced the `passive_physics_floor: true` config option with `passive_physics_scene: true`, which automatically assigns the `room_dimensions`, `performer_start_position`, and other properties for the scene. Please see the ILE API for more information.
    - Added the `passive_physics_setup` config property for the `structural_throwers` option, which sets the thrower's position and rotation to values used in our passive physics evaluation scenes. Possible choices include `"roll_angled"`, `"roll_straight"`, and `"toss_straight"`.
    - Added the `passive_physics_throw_force: true` and `passive_physics_collision_force: true` config properties for the `structural_throwers` option, which sets the thrower's `throw_force` to a value used in our passive physics evaluation scenes. We recommend against directly configuring `throw_force` for all passive physics scenes moving forward.
    - Added the `stop_position` confg property for the `structural_throwers` option, which sets the thrower's `throw_force` based on movement data we have recorded for use in our passive physics evaluation scenes. Possible choices include setting specific `x` and `z` values, setting `offscreen: true`, or setting `behind` with an object label to make the thrown object come to a stop behind a specific object (an occluder).
    - Updated all of the passive physics ILE example config files, and added `passive_physics_move_behind.yaml`.
    - Internally, the ILE Scene Generator now sets the `"intuitive_physics": true` tag in all passive physics JSON scene files, which instructs our Unity environment to automatically configure the room to preset specificiations. This tag is used in all of our passive physics evaluation scenes.
- Updated `goal` so that `"multi retrieval"` (used in number comparison and arithmetic tasks) and `"passive"` (used in seeing-leads-to-knowing tasks) are valid options for the `category`. Also added `targets` as a valid `goal` property for Multi-Retrieval goals. Please see our [Python API](https://nextcenturycorporation.github.io/MCS/api.html#machine_common_sense.GoalCategory) for more information on goals.
- Added the `performer_starts_near` config option to ensure the performer agent always starts a specific distance away from a specific object (including containers, occluders, platforms, ramps, the target, etc.).
- Added the `structural_turntables` config option to generate scenes containing rotating turntables (a.k.a. cogs).
- Added the `position_relative_to_start` config property for the `on_center` `keyword_location` to position objects on top of turntables and other furniture.
- Added the `adjacent_performer` `keyword_location` to position objects adjacent to the performer agent.
- Added the `along_wall` `keyword_location` to position objects adjacent to a specific exterior room wall.
- Added the `empty_placer` config property to the `placers` option to generate scenes containing empty placers (that do not hold any objects).
- Added the `end_height_relative_object_label` config property to the `placers` option so placers can dynamically adjust their drop height based on another object's height. Updated the passive physics gravity support example ILE config file to use this property so it more closely aligns with the corresponding evaluation task.
- Added the `distance_between_performer_and_tool` config property to the `shortcut_lava_target_tool` option for setting a specific distance between the performer agent's starting position and the tool.
- Added the `left_lava_width` and `right_lava_width` config properties to the `shortcut_lava_target_tool` option.
- Added the `has_long_blocking_wall` config property to the `shortcut_bisecting_platform` option.
- Added the `num_targets_minus` config property for generating a number of interactable objects based on the number of targets (especially useful for Multi-Retrieval tasks).
- Added the `side_wall_opposite_colors` and `wall_material` config options for setting textures on exterior room walls.
- Added the `trapezoidal_room` config option for generating scenes in trapezoidal rooms.
- Added the `labels`, `position`, and `rotation` config properties to the `keyword_objects` option.
- Added the `look_at_center` config property to the `teleports` option.
- Improved error messages.
- Fixed minor bugs with placers.
- Added new example ILE config files:
    - Basic usage and core common sense concepts:
        - `multiple_targets`
        - `starts_near_object`
        - `turntable`
    - New evaluation tasks:
        - `holes_with_agent`
        - `interactive_number_comparison`
        - `interactive_spatial_reorientation`
        - `lava_with_agent`
        - `ramps_with_agent`

#### Release 1.4

Changelog:
- Updated passive physics example YAML configs:
  - Added the `passive_physics_floor: true` config option to lower the friction of the floor to the same amount that's used in the passive physics evaluation scenes.
  - Removed the second platform and second "placed" object from `passive_physics_gravity_support.yaml` to better align with the evaluation task.
  - Updated the room dimensions to depict deeper rooms used in Evaluation 5.
  - Tweaked some `last_step` amounts to better align with the evaluation tasks.
- Added the `rotate_cylinders` config option to automatically rotate cylindrical objects onto their rolling sides in the `passive_physics_collisions` example config.
- Added the `opposite_x` and `opposite_z` keyword locations and made use of `opposite_x` in the `interactive_agent_identification` example config to bring it in closer alignment with the setup for the corresponding evaluation task.
- Updated the `passive_physics_collisions` example config to demonstrate how the static object can be positioned properly if you remove the occluder from the scene.
- Fixed a bug with cylinders being made too thin in some scenes.

#### Release 1.3

Changelog:
- Changed throwers to use "impulse" force mode by default; this is our recommended configuration moving forward. Please update your old thrower configurations (in your YAML files) to either use the `impulse: false` setting or adjust the `throw_force` setting (a good rule-of-thumb is to divide all of your non-impulse forces by 100). All of the example configs in this repository (the YAML files in `ile_configs/`) have been updated appropriately. For more information on force modes, please see `ForceMode.Force` and `ForceMode.Impulse` in [this documentation](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Rigidbody.AddForce.html).
- Created new example YAML configs for the [agent identification](./ile_configs/interactive_agent_identification.yaml) and [moving target prediction](./ile_configs/interactive_moving_target_prediction.yaml) tasks.
- Added `movement` config option under `specific_agents` to set a specific or random movement (either walking or running) path for an simulation-controlled agent.
- Added `auto_last_step` config option to set `last_step` relative to each scene's room dimensions.
- Added `circles` config option to force the performer agent to rotate in a complete clockwise circle (by using only RotateRight actions) at specific action steps.
- Added `performer_look_at` config option to make the performer agent start in a scene looking at a specific object.
- Added `dimensions` config option for all interactable objects that can be used instead of `scale` to set an object's size.
- Added `throw_force_multiplier` config option under `structural_throwers` to set throw forces relative to each scene's room dimensions.
- Added `has_blocking_wall` config option under `shortcut_bisecting_platform`.
- Added `auto_adjust_platforms` config option under `structural_platforms`.
- Fixed a bug where objects on top of containers held by placers (like the soccer ball in scenes generated with the interactive_support_relations.yaml config file) would fall and bounce rather than descending smoothly.
- Fixed a bug where holes and lava would be randomly positioned underneath other objects.
- Fixed a bug where scenes with manually-configured room dimensions and a random performer start position may cause the performer agent to start outside the room.
- Improved ILE startup time.
- Updated `shortcut_lava_room` config option to make use of the `partitionFloor` property recently introduced in MCS version 0.5.4.
- Updated `ile_configs/collisions.yaml` so the performer agent always faces the target.

#### Release 1.2

Changelog:
- Updated documentation and example configs, including: added new example configs corresponding to most new evaluation tasks; updated comments in existing example configs; restructured tables for example configs in the README; fixed bugs in the passive physics example configs to correctly drop objects behind occluders
- Added config options for generating agents in interactive scenes, either holding or not holding the retrieval target object (soccer ball)
- Updated the check_valid_path config option so it will now consider possible paths up and down ramps and across attached platforms
- Updated shapes allowed with droppers, placers, and throwers to include primitive types like triangles
- Added new containers for the support relations task
- Added config options to position objects relative to other objects
- Added a config option to randomize the target’s position via shortcut_lava_target_tool
- Added a config option to create a platform extension via shortcut_triple_door_choice
- Added an interactable object config option to generate objects with the same shape and size as another object
- Added a moving occluder config option to have the occluder move up again before last_step
- Added a placer config option to set its deactivation step
- Replaced the “rotation” thrower config option (for up/down rotation) with separate “rotation_y” and “rotation_z” config options to set both up/down and left/right rotation
- Improved error messages for delayed actions
- Fixed a bug where throwers with height 0 were incorrectly positioned inside the floor
- Fixed a bug where passive scenes were missing the goal’s “category” property
- Removed the shortcut_ramp_to_platform config option because it's redundant with recently-added platform options. To replace this in your configs, please use the following:

```yaml
structural_platforms:
    num: 1
    attached_ramps: 1
```

#### Release 1.1

Changelog:
- Added `check_valid_path` to generate scenes with a valid path between the performer agent's starting position and the retrieval target's position. Considers holes, lava, and all heavy objects in the scene. Does not currently consider ascending or descending ramps.
- Added `identical_to` as a configurable property for interactable objects to make them identical to another random object in the scene with regard to shape, scale, and material (color/texture).
- Added many new options for `structural_platforms`, including: `lips` to add lips around the perimeter of the platform; `attached_ramps` to add ramps attached to the platform; `platform_underneath` and `platform_underneath_attached_ramps` to generate two-level platforms.
- Added `open_topped_containers` as a possible `keyword` option for `keyword_objects`. The `in` option for `keyword_location` now works for open-topped containers.
- Added `shortcut_lava_room` to generate scenes with lava on both the left and right sides.
- Added `shortcut_start_on_platform` to generate scenes with the performer agent starting on a specifically-labeled, randomly-positioned platform.
- Added `shortcut_triple_door_choice` to generate "door occluders" like they will appear during the evaluation.
- Added [tool shapes](https://nextcenturycorporation.github.io/MCS/schema.html#tool-objects) and new options to configure tools, including: `tools`, for tools on their own; `shortcut_lava_target_tool`, to generate a tool, an island completely surrounded by lava, and a retrieval target positioned on the island.
- Created many new example config files and updated this README to map the evaluation tasks with useful configs.
- Generating a door now causes walls to be generated around the door.
- Fixed a bug with objects held by placers being set to the wrong height.
- Updated the max room dimensions to be 100 by 100.

Other Notes:
- Generated scenes should be run with [MCS release version 0.5.5](https://github.com/NextCenturyCorporation/MCS/releases/tag/0.5.5) or later.
- Areas of lava in scenes generated by ILE release 1.0 will not work correctly. If you wish to use old lava scenes, in their JSON files, please replace `floorTextures` with `lava`, and update the property's format as described in [our schema](https://nextcenturycorporation.github.io/MCS/schema.html).

#### Release 1.0

- Areas of lava do not yet impose a negative reward. We plan to implement this feature for a future release.
- All `soccer_ball` objects are restricted in scale to only values between 1 and 3 (inclusive). Invalid `soccer_ball` scale configurations will be ignored. The default scale for all `soccer_ball` objects is `MinMaxFloat(min=1.0, max=3.0)`.

## Scene Validation

In the `MCS` repository, in the `scripts` folder, use one of the following scripts to run all of the new scenes, depending on if you're running an interactive or passive (intuitive physics, agents, etc.) hypercube.

- [run_interactive_scenes.py](https://github.com/NextCenturyCorporation/MCS/blob/development/scripts/run_interactive_scenes.py) to load each scene (JSON file) starting with a given prefix and rotate in a circle.
- [run_passive_scenes.py](https://github.com/NextCenturyCorporation/MCS/blob/development/scripts/run_passive_scenes.py) to load each scene (JSON file) starting with a given prefix and pass until the scene is finished.

```
python run_interactive_scenes.py <mcs_unity_app> <file_path_prefix>
python run_passive_scenes.py <mcs_unity_app> <file_path_prefix>
```

(Please see the [scripts README](https://github.com/NextCenturyCorporation/MCS/blob/development/scripts/README.md) for more information.)

If you're validating scenes that you just made, and they're all in this folder, then the `<file_path_prefix>` will be `<mcs-scene-generator>/<prefix>`, where `<prefix>` is the filename prefix that you used to run the scene generator.
